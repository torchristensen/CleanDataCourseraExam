## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

 - Solution for course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera" course.
 - Included R script `run_analysis.R` solves the following actions:

<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.</li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set (called `mean_data`) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
<li>Outputs a `dataset.txt` file with result.
</ol>
